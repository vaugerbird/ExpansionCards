## Notes

Once my Framework arrives, I'd like to make an SDR card with [this SDR](https://www.nooelec.com/store/nesdr-nano2-plus.html) and [these USB A-to-C](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078N1TWG8?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share) adapters. 
I will need to desolder the IR reciever and maybe relocate it to the edge at some point, but I'm going to need to test how well IR goes through transparent filament.
